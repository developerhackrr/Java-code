What is Method overloading?
    If We define multiple methods with the
    same name but with different parameters
    we call this method creation as method overloading
    
    NOTE: C language doesnot have Method overloading
    
Why method overloading?
    If we want to perform same operation 
    for differentb inputs, we must develop
    Method overloading.
    
    -To perform same operation,  if we create methods
         with different name it will be confusion to
          other programmer while calling this method.
          
for example for adding diff type or list or order
numbers,characters and Strings we must define
multiple methods.here we must develop method overloading 
as it is the same operation with different types of inputs.

If we overload a method, when we call it which parameter
method is executed?
    - depending on argument we passed
    while calling method
    
 Develop a program define overloaded method 
 for adding two integers,three integers,integer
 and a String and Display result.
