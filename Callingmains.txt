if we find class name for variable creation or for parameter
creation, what is the value we must store and pass?
- we must store or pass that class object
- we must create object of a class by using new keyword

for example:
    A a1 = new A();
    B b1 = new B();
    Student s1 = new Student();
    Employee e1 = new Employee();
