ClassLoader working functionality:
    -Classloader loads classes into JVM based on classpath Enviroment variable setup.
    -To load class bytes into JVM, Classloader searches in the folders those are configured 
     in classpath enviroment variable.it searches all folders till it finds given class's".class
     file".if it not foundin any one of the folder then it throws "ClassnotFoundException" or
     "NoClassDefFoundError" exception.
     -if classpath is not at all created, it loads classes only from current working directory.
     -if classpath is created it is mandatory to place "." operator to load classes from current 
      working directory.
     -if the classpath enviroment variable has the character ";" not as a separator, it is
      treated as "." so that ClassLoader loads classes from current working directory.
      
Find out from which folder class is loaded and executed from the below syntax:
    -set classpath=C:\test                  <=class is loaded from C:\test
    -set classpath=.                        <=class is loaded from current working directory
    -set classpath=;                        <=class is loaded from current working directory
    -set classpath=.;C\test                 <=class is loaded from current working directory
    -set classpath=C:\test;                 <=class is loaded from C:\test
    -set classpath=Hariom;C:\test           <=class is loaded from C:\test
    -set classpath=Hariom;;C:\test          <=class is loaded from current working directory
    -set classpath=Hariom;C:\test;          <=class is loaded from C:\test
    -set classpath=Hariom                   <=JVM throws "java.lang.NoclassDefFoundError"
    -set classpath=Hariom;                  <=class is loaded from current working directory
